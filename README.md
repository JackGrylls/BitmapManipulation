# BitmapManipulation
Usage:
- Compile with ./build.sh
- Run with ./main.h <input>.bmp <output>.bmp <kernel size> <sigma>
- (Kernel size refers to the size of the gaussian kernel, somewhere between 5 and 15 is ideal)
- sigma controls the "intensity" of the blur

Planned features:
- Other filters aside from gaussian blur
